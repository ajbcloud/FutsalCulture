Here’s a structured 3-tier offering breakdown that works with your pricing ($99 / $199 / $499) and is designed so each tier has a clear jump in value without cannibalizing the others.

I’ve built it with two principles in mind:

Keep Tier 1 usable for small clubs without overwhelming them.

Make Tier 2 a “must have” for most serious organizations.

Make Tier 3 clearly enterprise-level with exclusives they can’t get elsewhere.

Tier 1 — Core ($99/mo)
Target: Small clubs, leagues, or coaches just starting to digitize operations.
Player Limit: Up to 150 active registered players per month (soft cap).

Features:

Session & registration management (create events, track sign-ups)

Parent & player portals (default theme)

Waitlist system (manual promotions only, no automation)

Location linking to Google Maps (basic)

Basic email notifications (system-branded)

Basic analytics dashboard (attendance, revenue summary)

Manual payment tracking (mark payments as received, no in-app checkout)

Standard support (48-hour response time)

No access to: In-app payments, SMS, white-label branding, API, advanced integrations.

Tier 2 — Growth ($199/mo)
Target: Established clubs and academies looking to automate, grow, and provide a better parent experience.
Player Limit: Up to 500 active registered players per month (soft cap).

Everything in Core, plus:

In-app payment processing (Stripe integration)

Automated waitlist promotions + notifications

SMS notifications for urgent updates

White-labeled emails (club logo, custom sender address)

Expanded analytics (revenue trends, player retention)

Basic integration options (Google Calendar, Twilio SMS, Mailchimp)

API access (read-only) for basic data sync

Priority email support (24-hour response time)

Tier 3 — Elite ($499/mo)
Target: Multi-location organizations, pro academies, or enterprise sports programs.
Player Limit: Unlimited active registered players

Everything in Growth, plus:

Fully customized parent/player portal (colors, branding, custom domain)

Advanced integration suite (Microsoft 365, QuickBooks, Zapier, etc.)

API access (full read/write, automation hooks)

Advanced analytics (cross-location performance, player progression, payment forecasting)

Priority support with dedicated account manager (phone + email)

Custom feature requests queue

Multi-tenant management (run multiple clubs/locations under one super admin account)

SSO options for staff (Google, Microsoft login)

Why this structure works
Core is “good enough” for small orgs but pushes them toward Tier 2 as soon as they want payments or automation.

Growth hits the sweet spot most will want — payments, automation, integrations, branding — while staying affordable.

Elite appeals to bigger orgs that value customization, enterprise integrations, and unlimited scaling.

Possible Add-Ons (Any Tier)
Extra player packs (e.g., $20/mo per 100 players over the limit in Tier 1 & 2)

Additional locations

One-time customization projects

here’s a tier-to-feature mapping for your SaaS so we can clearly control what’s enabled per subscription.
This assumes we’ll set feature flags or plan checks in the code, so the right modules, buttons, and API endpoints are only available if the customer’s plan supports them.

Technical Implementation Approach
Feature Flags: Use a plan_level field in the tenants table (core, growth, elite)

Plan Middleware: On every route and component render, check if the feature is allowed for the current plan_level

UI/UX Control: Hide unavailable features from the interface for lower tiers (don’t just disable; remove entirely to avoid confusion)

Upgrade Path: If they click on a disabled feature, trigger a modal explaining it’s available in a higher tier with a “Request Upgrade” button

here’s the full feature flag schema + integration checklist so your devs (or Replit agent) can drop it straight into the app and enforce the $99 / $199 / $499 tiers without ambiguity.

Feature Flag Schema
Database Table: feature_flags
Purpose: Store which features are enabled for each plan level.

Proposed Fields:

Column	Type	Description
id	UUID	Primary key
plan_level	ENUM	core, growth, elite
feature_key	TEXT	Unique key for feature (e.g., payments_enabled)
enabled	BOOLEAN	If feature is available for this plan
created_at	TIMESTAMP	Auto
updated_at	TIMESTAMP	Auto

Backend Enforcement Middleware (Pseudocode)
ts
Copy
Edit
function checkFeatureAccess(tenantId, featureKey) {
    const planLevel = getTenantPlanLevel(tenantId);
    const featureStatus = getFeatureFlag(planLevel, featureKey);

    if (!featureStatus) {
        throw new Error("Feature not available on your current plan");
    }
    return true;
}
Use this on API routes and in frontend components before rendering or processing any request.

Frontend Guard Example (React)
tsx
Copy
Edit
if (!hasFeature('payments_enabled')) {
  return <UpgradePrompt feature="Payments" />;
}
Integration Checklist Before Launch
✅ Add plan_level column to tenants table (default to core for new tenants)
✅ Create feature_flags table and populate with above JSON mapping
✅ Add middleware for backend API checks
✅ Add frontend utility function hasFeature(featureKey) for conditional rendering
✅ Add Upgrade Prompt modal linking to subscription management
✅ Test each tier with seed data to ensure features are correctly hidden or accessible
✅ Update subscription billing logic to switch plan_level when payment changes in Stripe
