Behavior to Implement
Calendar Day Popup

When the user clicks on a date cell in the calendar (e.g. FullCalendar or React Big Calendar), show a modal or popover listing all sessions on that day.

In this popup, do not include any “Book” or “Reserve” buttons. It’s purely informational.

Clickable Session Entries

Each session listing inside the popup should be a link (or clickable item) that navigates to its Session Detail & Reservation page:

swift
Copy
Edit
/sessions/{sessionId}?playerId={optional}
No booking action happens in the popup itself.

Reservation Page Eligibility Enforcement

On /sessions/{sessionId}, the “Select Player” dropdown should list all of the parent’s players.

Disable or hide any players whose age group or gender does not match the session’s requirements.

If a parent selects a non‑eligible player (shouldn’t be possible if they’re disabled), the “Reserve Spot” button remains disabled.

Task: Update the calendar and reservation flow as follows:

Calendar Popup: In the calendar component (CalendarView.tsx or similar), modify the eventClick or dayClick handler to open a modal that lists each session’s:

Title (e.g. “U12 Girls Afternoon Training”)

Time (e.g. “2:00 PM – 3:30 PM”)

Location

Spots filled (e.g. “3/10”)

Do not include any booking or reserve buttons here.

Session Links: Make each session line an <a> or Link to:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Link href={`/sessions/${session.id}`}>
  {session.title} — {formatTime(session.startTime)}
</Link>
Reservation Page Player Dropdown: In pages/sessions/[id].tsx, for the “Select Player” <Select>:

Fetch session.gender and computed session.ageGroup.

Filter user.players so only players matching both criteria are enabled in the dropdown.

Disabled options should appear greyed out with a tooltip:
"Not eligible: requires {session.gender} U{X} only."

Reserve Button State:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const eligible = selectedPlayer &&
  selectedPlayer.gender === session.gender &&
  calculateAgeGroup(selectedPlayer.birthYear) === session.ageGroup;
<button disabled={!eligible} ...>
Reserve Spot & Pay
</button>

**Styling & UX:**  
- Calendar popup matches dark theme (`bg-zinc-900`, `text-white`).  
- Disabled players in dropdown use `text-zinc-600` and `cursor-not-allowed`.  
- Tooltip can be via a `title` attribute or lightweight hover overlay.
