Build an onboarding system for the admin panel of the PlayHQ application.
Follow these instructions exactly.

Create a persistent onboarding bubble that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen on all admin pages.
The bubble must be movable and minimizable but cannot be dismissed until every onboarding checklist item has been manually checked off.
Store the checklist status in the database tied to the organization.
When all steps are completed, remove the bubble.

Inside the bubble show an ordered checklist. The steps must be:

Complete Organization Setup

Create Default Invite Code

Set Business Schedule and Fiscal Year

Configure Registration Settings

Configure Sessions and Schedule Settings

Create Locations

Configure Communication Settings

Complete Age Policy Setup

Review Billing and Plan Upgrades

Each item must expand inside the bubble to show a description explaining what is required. Admins must manually check off completion. Do not auto complete any item.

Build the following backend and frontend logic for each step.

Step One Organization Setup
Create a settings screen where admins can enter
organization name, logo, support email, support phone, support hours, business location, and time zone.
Provide form fields and save all values to the organization settings table.
Mark the step complete only when the admin checks the box.

Step Two Invite Code Setup
Create a field for a default invite code.
Also provide a Manage Invite Codes page to create additional invite codes.
Save codes in an invite codes table.
Mark the step complete when the admin checks the box.

Step Three Business Schedule and Fiscal Year
Add fields for start day of week and fiscal year type.
Save these values to organization settings.

Step Four Registration Settings
Add toggles for
auto approve new parent or player signups
manual approval
show help request navigation menu on client dashboard

Step Five Sessions and Schedule
Add fields for
session capacity warning threshold
payment submission time
waitlist toggle
auto promotion toggle
payment reminder toggle
refund cut off toggle

Add logic for auto promotion if the plan level supports it.
Move waitlist message templates to the Communications tab.
Fix SMS notification settings to remove Twilio references.

Step Six Locations
Create a screen where admins can add and manage locations.
Move this section above session settings in the UI.

Step Seven Communications
Consolidate all messaging settings into a single Communications tab.
Include email templates, SMS templates, waitlist templates, and reminder templates.
Remove the text about white label emails.

Step Eight Age Policy
Add fields for minimum age, maximum age, and teen self signup age.
Combine require adult account and teen self signup fields if possible.
Audit the enforce age gating toggle and either document its function or remove it.
Consent forms must be fully editable with the ability to enable or disable individual forms and create new ones.

Step Nine Billing
Add a simple section that links to plan upgrade options.

The onboarding bubble must read from and write to the onboarding status table.
Use a boolean field for each step.

Build clean UI components that work with the existing design.
Use a light card layout inside the bubble with clear checkboxes and progress count.
The bubble must remain visible until all steps are finished.
