Add Mobile-Only Responsive Styles Without Touching Desktop Layout

We need to layer in a fully mobile-friendly experience for parents and players—without altering the existing desktop design—by using responsive CSS breakpoints or Tailwind utilities. Please implement the following:

1. Approach
Mobile-First Base
All unprefixed CSS/Tailwind classes apply to mobile (≤640px).

Desktop Overrides
Wrap desktop-only styles in sm: or @media (min-width: 640px) so they take effect only on larger screens.

This ensures our current desktop layout remains untouched, and mobile users get the optimized styles automatically.

2. Navigation & Layout
Hamburger Menu

Hide sidebar and show hamburger button by default (mobile).

Use Tailwind:

html
Copy
Edit
<button class="sm:hidden p-4" @click="open = !open">☰</button>
<nav :class="open ? 'block' : 'hidden' sm:block">…desktop sidebar…</nav>
Single-Column Stacking

Make all cards, tables, and form sections full-width (w-full) by default.

Restore multi-column on sm: and above, e.g.:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="w-full sm:w-1/2 lg:w-1/4 p-4">…card…</div>
3. Components
Buttons & Tap Targets

Ensure all buttons and clickable elements use at least p-4 or h-11 w-11 for a 44×44 px tappable area.

Add sm:p-2 if you want smaller padding on desktop only.

Forms

Inputs: w-full with labels above.

Multi-selects: default native full-screen pickers on mobile; wrap in sm:appearance-none sm:bg-white for desktop styling.

Tables → Cards

Hide desktop tables on mobile:

html
Copy
Edit
<table class="hidden sm:table">…</table>
Show card list on mobile:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="space-y-4 sm:hidden">
  <template v-for="row in rows">
    <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow">…row details…</div>
  </template>
</div>
Charts & KPI Cards

By default show a vertical scrollable list of the top 2–3 KPI Cards (overflow-x-auto).

Desktop grid reinstated under sm:grid sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4.

4. Touch & Gestures
Accordions:

Mobile: tap to expand/collapse session details.

Use cursor-pointer and focus:outline-none on mobile rows.

Pull-to-Refresh:

Wrap key lists in a container that listens for pull-down gestures (overscroll-y-auto).

Swipe Actions:

Implement swipe-left to reveal “Edit/Delete” on parent/player cards using a lightweight JS library or CSS.

5. Performance & Accessibility
Lazy Load charts and lists with v-lazy or intersection-observer.

Optimize images/SVGs to <100 KB.

ARIA & Contrast: ensure all mobile elements have aria-label, sufficient color contrast, and logical tab order.

6. Testing
Use BrowserStack or device emulators to test on iOS & Android Chrome/Safari at widths 320–640 px.

Run Lighthouse audits for mobile performance and accessibility.

Beta-test with actual parents on phones to catch any “fat-finger” or layout issues.

Implement all mobile-only CSS in a separate Tailwind file or within your existing Tailwind config using unprefixed classes for mobile and sm: prefixed classes for desktop. Do not modify any existing desktop-only styles—those should remain in place under their sm:, md:, or lg: prefixes.
