Filter Controls in Key Admin Sections
1.1 Sessions, Payments & Players Pages
What:
– Add filters at the top of each list page: date range, age group, gender, location, payment status (for payments).
– Combine these with search and pagination controls.

Why:
Admins need to quickly narrow down large data sets—e.g. see only U12 Girls sessions this week, or view pending payments for U10 Boys.

2. Seed Test Data for Help Requests & Players
2.1 Help Requests
What:
– Insert several sample rows into help_requests table:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO help_requests (name, phone, email, note)
VALUES
  ('Jane Doe','555-0001','jane@example.com','How do I change my child’s age?'),
  ('John Smith','555-0002','john@example.com','My Venmo payment didn’t go through.');
Why:
Allows you to verify the Help Requests page UI, reply flows, and “Resolve” functionality without having to submit forms manually.

2.2 Players
What:
– Ensure at least one player (Harper Brind) is linked to a parent record in players and users tables.
– Add a second parent relationship for that same player for testing.

Why:
Validates parent‑player linking, multi‑parent scenarios, and ensures the roster page shows correct parent associations.

3. Parent Management Section in Admin Portal
3.1 New “Parents” Nav Item
What:
– Create /admin/parents page listing all parent accounts: Name, Email, Phone, # of Players.
– Actions: Edit (manage account & 2FA), View Linked Players, Delete.

Why:
Admins need an overview of family accounts—especially when players now can have two parents each.

4. Two‑Parent Support Everywhere
4.1 Data Model Update
What:
– Create join table parent_players with parentId & playerId so each player can have multiple parents.

Why:
Supports shared management access, accurate notification delivery via both parents, and correct analytics grouping.

4.2 UI Updates
– Parent Portal: allow inviting a second parent under each player’s “Manage Parents” section.
– Player Portal: show both parent contacts (email/SMS) if permissions granted.
– Admin Roster & Reports: display both parents in player rows.

5. Detailed Analytics Enhancements
5.1 Profile‑Level vs. Account‑Level Filtering
What:
– On Analytics page, add a “View by” toggle:

Account (counts per parent account)

Profile (counts per unique player)

Why:
Prevent double‑counting when two parents access the same child’s activity.

5.2 Expanded Metrics
What:
Add these KPI panels & charts:

Active Players by Age Group & Gender (bar chart)

Bookings per Location (pie chart)

New Parent Accounts vs. New Player Profiles (dual‑line chart)

Reminder Opt‑In Rates (email vs. SMS)

Average Revenue per Player

Session Fill Time (time from release at 8 AM to full capacity)

Why:
Gives granular insight into user behavior, facility usage, and revenue drivers.

Add Filter UI components to Sessions, Payments, Players pages.

Seed Test Data for help requests and players multi‑parent scenario.

Build Parents Page under /admin/parents with CRUD and link‑to‑players.

Migrate to Many‑to‑Many parent_players table and update all UIs & APIs.

Enhance Analytics page with profile vs. account toggle and new KPIs.
