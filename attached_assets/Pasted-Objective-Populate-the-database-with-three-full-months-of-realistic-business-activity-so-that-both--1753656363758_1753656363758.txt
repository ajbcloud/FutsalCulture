Objective: Populate the database with three full months of realistic business activity so that both the Admin Dashboard and Analytics Dashboard display consistent, believable trends and statistics. All data—sessions, players, signups, payments, and notifications—must align so metrics like “Total Revenue,” “Monthly Growth,” “Fill Rate,” and “Player Growth” all make sense together.

1. Date Range & Growth Patterns
Time span: April 1 2025 → June 30 2025 (three calendar months).

Growth trajectory:

April: Soft launch—average 6 players per session, 30 unique players by month’s end.

May: Momentum—average 8 players per session, 50 unique players by month’s end.

June: Peak season—average 10 players per session, 75 unique players by month’s end.

2. Sessions Schedule
Days: Monday–Friday each week.

Times: 5:00 PM, 6:45 PM, 8:30 PM (1.5 hour each).

Locations: Sugar Sand Park only.

Age Groups/Genders: Cycle evenly through U8–U15 Boys and U8–U15 Girls so that each cohort runs roughly the same number of sessions per month.

Capacity: 12 spots.

Price: $10.00 per session.

3. Parents & Players
Parents: Create 20 distinct parent accounts with realistic names and emails.

Players: For each parent, assign 1–2 players (so ~30–35 players total), birth years corresponding to U8–U15.

Portal Access:

First half of players get portal access and booking permissions from day 1.

Second half are added gradually: 10 new portal‑enabled players in May, 15 more in June.

4. Signups & Payments
For each session in April: randomly select 4–8 eligible players to sign up.

In May: 6–10 signups per session.

In June: 8–12 signups per session.

Timing: Generate each signup’s created_at 1–48 hours before the session start.

Payments: Mark all but 10% of signups as paid immediately (simulate some pending in each month). Create payments records with paid_at matching signup time plus a few minutes.

5. Pending Payments & Help Requests
For each month, leave 5–10% of signups unpaid and older than 1 hour to show up under “Pending Payments.”

Seed 5–8 help requests per month with mixed resolved/unresolved status, so the “Recent Activity” feed shows questions like “Can’t see my booking” or “Forgot my password.”

6. Notification Preferences
Assign each parent an email opt‑in = true; SMS opt‑in = random true/false.

Seed a few (3–5) SMS reminders and email reminders sent per week, so “Recent Activity” shows actual reminders.

7. Analytics Consistency Checks
After seeding:

April Revenue: ~ (number of sessions × avg attendees × $10)

May Revenue: ~ 1.5× April

June Revenue: ~ 2× April

Total Players: 30 (April) → 50 (May) → 75 (June)

Monthly Growth% shown on dashboard should match these ratios.

Fill Rate: April ~50%, May ~67%, June ~83%

Sessions This Week: Reflect actual count for current week in June.

Recent Activity: Show a scrolling list of that day’s signups, payments, and help tickets.

Implementation Guidance:

Write or update a seed.ts script using Drizzle‑ORM (or raw SQL) to insert this data.

Use loops over dates and randomization within bounds to generate session and signup records.

Ensure foreign‑key relationships (players → parents; signups → sessions, players; payments → signups).

Run this script against the development database, then launch the app and verify all dashboard cards and charts display the expected numbers and trends.
