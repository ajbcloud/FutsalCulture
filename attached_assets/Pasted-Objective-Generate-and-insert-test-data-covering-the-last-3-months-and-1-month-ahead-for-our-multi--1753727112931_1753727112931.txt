Objective:
Generate and insert test data covering the last 3 months and 1 month ahead for our multi-tenant Futsal Reserve platform. All dates, counts, and dollar amounts should be internally consistent—sessions must have matching sign-ups, payments tied to those sign-ups, and analytics metrics (revenue, new players, fill rates, pending payments, growth rates) should compute correctly from the generated data.

Tenants:

Create 2 tenants (e.g. “Futsal Culture” and “Elite Footwork Academy”), each with their own subdomain, contact info, address, and billing settings.

Admins & Users:

For each tenant, seed 1 super-admin and 2 regular admin users.

Seed 20 parents per tenant. Assign each a unique email, phone, and approval timestamp.

Seed 30–40 players per tenant. Each player must reference one of the tenant’s parents (randomly distribute 1–3 players per parent), record DOB so ages span U8–U18, and include created_at timestamps over the past 3 months.

Sessions:

For each tenant, schedule ~3 sessions per week over the past 3 months plus 4 sessions in the coming month.

Vary ageGroups (U8–U18), genders (boys, girls, mixed), locations (3 distinct parks), capacities (8–20).

For closed/past sessions, randomly sign 50–95% of capacity; for future sessions, sign 0–30% to simulate early sign-ups.

Sign-ups & Payments:

For every session sign-up, create a signup record with a payment intent linked.

90% of completed signups should have paid=true with paid_at timestamp within 1 hour of sign-up; 10% should be paid=false and show up as pending payments older than 1 hour.

Charge each sign-up between $15–$25; record amount_cents accordingly.

Help Requests & Notifications:

Insert 5–10 help_requests per tenant over the 3-month window: issues like “Can’t book session,” “Payment didn’t go through,” “Password reset.”

Mark 70% resolved with timestamps and admin replies, leave the rest unresolved.

Analytics Alignment:

Ensure that when you sum payments in each calendar month you get sensible “Total Revenue,” and that the Year-to-Date (YTD) revenue matches the sum from Jan 1 to today.

New registrations per month (players and parents) should track roughly +10% month-over-month to produce positive growth rates.

Fill-rate metrics: compute average capacity utilization per month to show 60–90% fill.

Pending payments widget should display the count of unpaid signups older than 1 hour at “now.”

Future-Dated Data:

Create 4 sessions in next month with realistic sign-up curves (e.g. 5–15% booked), and seed a handful of early sign-ups/payments.

No help requests or new players in the future.

Execution:

Generate this data in your Drizzle-ORM seed script (e.g. seed.ts or expanded-seed.ts).

Use new Date() offsets (e.g. subtract months/weeks) so the timestamps always roll relative to “now.”

After seeding, run your analytics API and verify the dashboard widgets (Total Revenue, Total Players, YTD Revenue, Sessions This Week, Total Registrations, Pending Payments, Growth %) all reflect the seeded numbers.

Goal:
When you launch the Admin Dashboard and Analytics pages, charts should show a smoothly rising player count, revenue spikes aligned with session schedules, accurate fill-rates, and a handful of pending payments—all drawn directly from this cohesive three-month + one-month-ahead dataset.
