Goal: strip out the subject and category fields from both the user‑facing “Send us a message” form and the admin “Help Requests” table and API, including database, schema, storage, API routes, front‑end form, and admin list.

1. Database & Schema
Remove columns

In your Drizzle schema (shared/schema.ts), remove the subject and category columns from the help_requests table definition.

Migration

Generate and run a migration to drop those two columns from the help_requests table in Postgres.

2. Server‑Side Storage & API
Storage Interface

In server/storage.ts (or wherever you define HelpRequests CRUD), remove any references to subject and category.

API Routes

In server/admin-routes.ts and server/routes.ts (the public route for POST /api/help-requests), update the handler signatures:

Delete req.body.subject and req.body.category destructuring.

Adjust the insert call so it only writes name, email, phone, priority, message.

Type Definitions

If you have a HelpRequest TypeScript interface, delete subject and category from it.

Outgoing JSON

In the admin listing endpoint (GET /api/admin/help-requests), stop selecting subject and category—only return id, priority, name, email, phone, message, status, createdAt.

3. Client‑Side Form
Form Component

In client/src/components/HelpRequestForm.tsx (or wherever your form lives), remove the <Input> and <Select> for Subject and Category.

Validation

Adjust any Zod/Yup schema or React Hook Form rules so they no longer expect subject or category.

API Call

In client/src/lib/api.ts (where you fetch('/api/help-requests')), delete subject and category from the JSON payload you send.

4. Admin Help Requests Page
Columns

In client/src/pages/admin/help-requests.tsx, remove the table columns for Subject and Category.

Row Renderer

When you map over each request, stop destructuring subject and category.

Shift the other columns (User, Priority, Status, Created) left so there’s no gap.

Filters & Search

If you had category filters, remove them.

5. Clean‑Up & Testing
Console & Types

Search the entire repo for subject and category in the help‑requests context and remove unused imports/types.

End‑to‑End Smoke Test

Submit a new help request via the public form → verify it lands in the DB without subject/category.

Go to Admin → Help Requests → confirm the new row appears correctly, and there’s no column for Subject or Category.

SQL Console

In your Neon dashboard, verify the help_requests table no longer has those two columns.
