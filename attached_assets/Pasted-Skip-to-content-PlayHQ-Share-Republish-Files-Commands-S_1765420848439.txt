Done! I've updated all email sender addresses across the codebase: **Welcome/invitation emails now use:** `welcome@playhq.app` - New user invitations - Welcome emails after signup - Parent2 invite emails **General/transactional emails now use:** `playhq@playhq.app` - Password reset emails - Verification codes - Session reminders - Admin notifications - Bulk campaigns - System announcements The app is running and ready. These changes are in development - you'll need to publish to make them live on playhq.app.

This is a production vs development sync issue. Here's what's happening: **The Problem:** The invite code validation was recently updated to check for `metadata.inviteType === "coach_invite"`. If the invite in production was created before you published these recent changes, it won't have the required metadata and will fail validation - even though the code exists. **Solutions:** 1. **Quickest fix**: Go to the Admin → Coaches page in production and **re-send the coach invite**. The new invite will have the correct metadata. 2. **Long-term fix**: Publish the latest development changes to production so all the recent improvements are live. Would you like me to help you publish the app so all the recent security fixes and improvements are deployed to production?

i already published the updates to prodcution. when the coach clicks the join button arent they supposed to have to fill in the clerk data? the coach is never prompted ot enter in their details to join, just gets invalid code.

the way i think it should work is that the admin creates a coach in the app, the data should be added to the database just like we do for the invited parents. they will get an email to join the club and should be prompted to fill out the clerk data which should check against the database and update the database or something liek that. it doesnt seem liek this is happening, but the firs tproblem is the link doesnt work

I see the critical issue now - the production logs show **database tables are missing**. The error `relation "tenant_credits" does not exist` means the production database hasn't been synced with the latest schema changes. This is likely causing all the issues. Let me check what's needed to fix this:

cisco Umbrella networks, roaming clients need to be consilidated into cisco umbrella

I see the issue - after Clerk signup, the invite code from the URL is being lost. Let me look at the join-as-coach page to fix this:

I see the issue. The loop is happening because after Clerk signup, the `isAuthenticated` from the app's auth context hasn't synced yet, so it keeps falling back to the "welcome" step. Let me fix this:
i kept clicking through and eventualy it logged me in but to the parent page as well. i shouldnt have even seen that as an option considering i was brough on as a coach

Decided user primary role
I see the issue. The coach join creates a coach assignment but doesn't update the user's primary role, so they still land on the parent page. Let me fix this:
