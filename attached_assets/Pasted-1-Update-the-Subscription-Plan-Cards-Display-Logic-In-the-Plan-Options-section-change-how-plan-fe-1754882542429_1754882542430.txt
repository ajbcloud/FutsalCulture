1. Update the Subscription Plan Cards Display Logic

In the Plan Options section, change how plan features are displayed:

Keep the Free plan listing all of its features as it does now.

For each plan after Free:

Add a first bullet point at the top of its feature list that reads:

Core: “Includes everything in Free, plus…”

Growth: “Includes everything in Core, plus…”

Elite: “Includes everything in Growth, plus…”

Style this first bullet so it is slightly muted or italic to indicate it’s an informational line, not a standard feature.

Remove any features from higher-tier lists that are exact duplicates of features already included in the tier directly before it.

If a feature changes or upgrades between tiers (for example: “Basic Analytics” in Core → “Advanced Analytics” in Growth), replace it in the higher tier’s list with the upgraded label, not an X for the old one.

Keep the existing green check mark styles and descriptions for listed features, but avoid showing red Xs in higher tiers if the feature is replaced with a better one.

The pricing card data should still be driven from the single plans.config.ts file, but the rendering logic should:

Compare each tier’s features with the tier before it.

Output only the new or upgraded features for that tier.

Always prepend the “Includes everything in [previous tier]” bullet.

Ensure all changes maintain light/dark mode support and mobile responsiveness.

2. Replace the Feature Availability Section

Remove the current “Feature Availability” list view entirely.

Replace it with the feature grid design we previously created, where:

Features are listed as rows.

Plans (Free, Core, Growth, Elite) are columns.

Each cell clearly indicates availability:

Green check for included.

Empty/grey dash for not included.

Text variation for upgraded features (e.g., “Advanced” vs “Basic”).

Integrations, communications, analytics, and other grouped categories are clearly sectioned with headers.

The feature grid must reflect the exact feature distribution rules we finalized:

Email available in Core and higher, SMS only in Growth and Elite.

CSV export in Core+, CSV import in Growth+.

No waitlist in Free.

Integrations: Core has only calendar integrations, Growth adds Stripe, Elite adds API + multiple payment integrations.

Growth’s payments limited to Stripe only, Elite supports multiple payment providers.

Access codes & discount codes start in Core.

Feature request queue: Core & Growth get standard, Elite gets priority.

Support levels: Core = basic, Growth = standard, Elite = high priority phone/email.

Advanced Player Development is Elite only.

Match the grid’s style to the rest of the admin interface and make sure it works in both light and dark mode.

The grid should pull from the same plans.config.ts data so there is only one source of truth.

3. QA and Testing

Test in both light and dark mode for readability and visual pop.

Confirm that plan cards and feature grid show the correct features and upgrades per tier.

Confirm that no duplicate features appear unnecessarily and that upgraded features are displayed with their correct new labels.
