Implement a new Free Plan tier for the application with the following restrictions and functionality:

1. User Limit:

Maximum of 10 total registered users (this includes parents and players combined).

If a new user tries to register once the 10-user limit is reached, the system must block the registration and display a customizable message set by the admin (default: “You have reached the maximum allowed users for your plan. Please upgrade to add more.”).

The Super Admin portal should show a “Free Plan” badge and a user count tracker (e.g., 8/10 users).

2. Session Creation Restrictions:

Sessions can only be created manually via the admin portal.

Disable any recurring session automation features for the Free Plan.

No ability to bulk import sessions from CSV or API integrations.

Show a tooltip or lock icon next to disabled features explaining they require an upgrade.

3. Communication Restrictions:

Disable all automated or mass email and SMS notifications for the Free Plan.

Admins can still view the “Communication” section but all send actions should be disabled with an upgrade prompt.

4. Analytics Restrictions:

Disable access to all analytics dashboards and KPI metrics for Free Plan tenants.

The “Analytics” menu item should still be visible but greyed out, showing a modal with the message “Analytics are available on Growth and Elite plans.”

5. Payment Processing:

Disable online payment processing for sessions in the Free Plan.

The “Accept Payments” toggle in session creation should be locked with an upgrade prompt.

6. UI Indicators:

Add a “Free Plan” label in the tenant’s admin dashboard header.

Any locked or restricted feature must have a tooltip or modal explaining which plan unlocks it.

7. Upgrade Path:

Add a persistent “Upgrade Now” button in the top-right of the admin dashboard for Free Plan tenants.

Clicking “Upgrade Now” should open the pricing page with a pre-selected plan upgrade flow.

8. Mobile-Friendly:

Ensure all Free Plan restrictions and upgrade prompts are fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

9. Database & Logic:

Store the tenant’s plan type in the database.

All feature access checks must validate against the plan type before allowing an action.

Make sure these checks exist on both front-end (UI lock) and back-end (security enforcement).
