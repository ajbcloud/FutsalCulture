I understand you want me to prepare everything for deployment except actually deploying the app live. Let me set up the deployment configuration and prepare your app for production deployment.


Opened package.json

Opened vite.config.ts
Now let me prepare your application for production deployment to playhq.app. I'll configure the production settings, environment variables, and deployment files.


Created .env.example

Created deployment-checklist.md

Opened server/index.ts
Now let me add production environment configuration and CORS settings for your domain:


Edited server/index.ts

Created production.md

Created cloudflare-setup.md
Now let me test the production build to ensure everything is ready for deployment:


Executed npm run build
Perfect! The production build completed successfully. Now let me create a final deployment guide and update the documentation:


Created DEPLOYMENT-READY.md

Edited replit.md
Perfect! I've completed all the preparation work for deploying your application to playhq.app. Here's what I've accomplished:
