Here is the straight, practical path to move your app off Replit and into Google’s Antigravity environment without losing your database or secrets. No fluff. No guesses.

## Step 1: Export your code from Replit

You already have GitHub connected, which makes this easy.

1. Open your Replit project
2. Push the entire repo to GitHub using the Replit GitHub sync
3. Verify on GitHub that your most recent commit includes everything

   * All app code
   * Any migrations
   * Your package files
   * Your environment config templates

You now treat GitHub as the source of truth.

## Step 2: Retrieve your secrets from Replit

Replit does not export secrets through GitHub, so you must do this manually.

1. In your Replit project, open the Secrets panel
2. Copy each secret name and value
3. Paste them into a local `.env` file on your machine (temporary) or directly into Antigravity’s environment variables once the project is created

You will recreate every secret manually in Google’s environment.

## Step 3: Migrate your database

This depends on what database you used:

### If you used Replit DB

You cannot export it directly. You must do one of these:

Option A:
Write a small script in Replit to read all keys and values and output a JSON file, then download that file, then import into your new database.

Option B:
If your app already abstracts data behind a repository layer, rewrite the backend to point at a real database (Postgres or Firestore), then write a one time migration script to pull data from Replit DB and insert into the new store.

### If you used SQLite (most common in Rails apps)

1. Download your `development.sqlite3` or whichever file is in your repo
2. Commit it to GitHub if needed
3. Decide what your target database will be

   * Cloud SQL for Postgres
   * SQLite managed by Antigravity (only recommended for early dev)
4. Run `rails db:schema:load` on the new environment
5. Import your data if needed

   * If SQLite to Postgres, use `pgloader` or export to CSV then import

### If you used Postgres with a Replit hosted extension

1. Connect to the database using `psql` from your local machine
2. Run

   ```
   pg_dump --format=custom --no-owner --no-privileges -h HOST -p PORT -U USER DBNAME > dump.pg
   ```
3. Upload that dump into your Google Antigravity database
4. Restore it

   ```
   pg_restore --no-owner --role=yournewrole -h NEWHOST -U NEWUSER -d NEWDB dump.pg
   ```

## Step 4: Recreate your environment in Google Antigravity

Antigravity behaves like a managed cloud environment. You will need to:

1. Create a new Antigravity app
2. Connect the GitHub repo
3. Set your environment variables in the Antigravity config
4. Choose your runtime
5. Point your app to your migrated database
6. Deploy

## Step 5: Replace Replit integrations

Any Replit specific features must be rewritten or replaced.

Examples

* Replit persistent storage becomes Cloud SQL, Firestore, or another real DB
* Replit Secrets become Antigravity environment variables
* Replit web server port may need `PORT` set manually for Google
* Replit agent features will not migrate and must be rebuilt or removed

## Step 6: Test everything before cutting over

Create a full testing checklist:

* Authentication
* Database CRUD
* Webhooks
* Background jobs
* API integrations
* File uploads
* Any AI features

Once everything passes, shut off the Replit instance.

## If you want, I can map your exact app structure

If you tell me:

* What framework the app uses
* What database you use
* What secrets you have
* What integrations are active

I can give you a step by step plan custom to your exact app, including what code to copy, what scripts to write, and how to run the migration cleanly.

Just tell me your stack.
